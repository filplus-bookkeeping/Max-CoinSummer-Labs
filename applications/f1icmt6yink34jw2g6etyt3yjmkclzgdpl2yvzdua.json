    "Brief history of your project and organization": "As a pioneer in AI data services, Feige has been dedicated to providing comprehensive data solutions for algorithm enterprises since 2018. We have integrated a unified service system of software and hardware, covering the full-process services including data collection, verification, cleaning, desensitization, annotation, storage, and transmission. With professional technical capabilities and premium service quality, Feige has successfully served over 30 AI enterprise clients, including industry leaders such as MEGVII (Face++), SenseTime, and JD Finance. To date, we have provided more than 20 million annotated image data sets, with approximately 200,000 professional crowd-workers collaborating on our platform.\r\n\r\nAs a deep participant in the Web3 ecosystem, Feige is actively advancing the storage deployment of machine learning and deep learning datasets on the Filecoin network. We focus on three core areas of artificial intelligence: Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Speech Processing. We firmly believe that storing high-value datasets through Web3 technology - including autonomous driving, cancer research, disease diagnosis, geographic information, agricultural production, speech recognition, and natural language processing - will bring revolutionary changes to the industry.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "We have performed a re-annotation of the [Multiview Extended Video with Activities (MEVA)](https://registry.opendata.aws/mevadata/) dataset by:\r\n\r\n1. Decomposing the videos into individual frames;\r\n2. Applying computer vision algorithms for automated annotation;\r\n3. Implementing manual verification of the annotations;\r\n4. Reconstructing the frames back into complete video sequences;\r\n\r\nThe resulting annotated dataset is intended for AI model training and research in multi-view human activity scenarios.",
